### Configuration settings for internal implementation:

#### conf/application.conf

```
 gform {
   host = localhost  # two-way-message host
   port = 8970       # two-way-mesage port
   path-prefix = /two-way-message
 }
```

#### two-way-message.yaml of <app-config-[qa|development|staging|prod]>
```
    microservice.services.gform.host: two-way-message.protected.mdtp
    microservice.services.gform.port: 443
    microservice.services.gform.protocol: https
    microservice.services.gform.path-prefix: /two-way-message
```

### Configuration settings for gfrom microservice:

```
 gform {
   host = localhost
   port = 9196              # gform port
   path-prefix = /gform
